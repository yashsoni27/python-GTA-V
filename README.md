# python-GTA-V
Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5, mainly for the purposes of creating self driving cars in open environment.

We try to read frames from the desktop rather than messing with games codes itself. This means generally we can use it to work with more games than GTA V, and it basically tries to learn whatever you put in front of it counting frames as input and generating key presses as output.

Currently this project is under work.
I would like to not help in this project!
